## Overview

IndieGO represents a paradigm shift in Discord developer tools. Unlike conventional bots that rely on external APIs, IndieGO leverages cutting-edge local processing techniques - making it more private, secure, responsive, and customizable for development communities.

What truly sets IndieGO apart is its unprecedented ability to transform Discord from a simple chat platform into a full-fledged development environment where teams can write, review, and improve code together in real-time.

## üì• Getting Started

### Invite the Bot

[Click here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1304755116255088670) to add IndieGO to your server.

### Self-Hosting

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file
4. Run the bot: `python main.py`

## ü§ñ Custom AI Model

IndieGO is powered by a custom transformer-based language model specifically designed for code understanding and generation. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of code, documentation, and programming Q&A.

### Model Architecture

- **Base Architecture**: Transformer with 32 layers and 32 attention heads
- **Context Length**: 4096 tokens
- **Embedding Dimension**: 4096
- **Parameters**: ~6.7B
- **Training Data**: Python code, documentation, Stack Overflow Q&A

### Training Process

1. **Data Preparation**:

   ```bash
   python ai_model/prepare_data.py
   ```

   Downloads and processes training data from various sources.

2. **Model Training**:

   ```bash
   python ai_model/train.py \
       --train_file datasets/final/train.jsonl \
       --validation_file datasets/final/validation.jsonl \
       --output_dir checkpoints \
       --num_train_epochs 3
   ```

   Trains the model on prepared datasets.

3. **Model Serving**:

   ```bash
   python ai_model/serve.py
   ```

   Starts the model server for bot integration.

### Model Capabilities

- Code generation from natural language descriptions
- Code explanation and documentation
- Bug detection and fixes
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Style improvements
- Security vulnerability detection

### Integration

The model is integrated with the Discord bot through a FastAPI service, enabling:

- Real-time code analysis
- Interactive code generation
- Contextual Q&A
- Code review automation
